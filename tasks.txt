REST API - JSON

GET /api/ users - list all the users                                      DONE 

GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1                                 DONE
GET /api/users/2 - Get user with ID 2                                     DONE

POST /api/users - Create new user

PATCH /api/users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE /api/users/1 - Delte the user with ID 1
